==== ||

An `||` (or) evaluates its left hand side. If its _falsey_, it evaluates its right hand side
and has that value. Otherwise it has the value of the left hand side.
Its type it the union of the types of both sides.

You can think of an `||` as syntax sugar of an `if`:

[source,ruby]
-------------
some_exp1 || some_exp2

# The above is the same as:
tmp = some_exp1
if tmp
  tmp
else
  some_exp2
end
