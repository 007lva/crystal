=== Local Variables

Local variables start with lowercase letters or underscore.
They are declared when you first assign them a value.

[source,ruby]
-------------
name = "Crystal"
age = 1
-------------

Their type is inferred from their usage, not only from their initializer.
In general, they are just value holders associated with the type that
the programmer expects them to have according to their location and usage
on the program.

For example, reassinging a variable with a different expression makes it have
that expression's type:

[source,ruby]
-------------
var = "Hello"
# At this point 'var' is a String

var = 1
# At this point 'var' is an Int32
-------------
