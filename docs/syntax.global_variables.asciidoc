=== Global Variables

Global variables start with a dollar sign (`'$'`).
They are declared when you first assign them a value.

[source,ruby]
-------------
$year = 2014
-------------

Their type is the combined type of all expressions that were assigned to them.
Additionally, if you program reads a global variable before it was ever assigned
a value it will also have the `Nil` type.

==== Thread-local

You can mark a global variable as thread-local with the `@:ThreadLocal` attribute:

[source,ruby]
-------------
@:ThreadLocal
$year = 2014
-------------
