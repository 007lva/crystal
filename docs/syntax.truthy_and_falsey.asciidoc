==== Truthy and falsey

A _truthy_ value is a value that is considered `true` for an `if`, `unless`,
`while` or `until` guard. A _falsey_ value is a value that is considered `false`
in those places.

The only _falsey_ values are `nil`, `false` and null pointers (pointers whose
memory address is zero). Any other value is _truthy_.

WARNING: If you come from C/C++, be warned that zero (0) is _truthy_.
